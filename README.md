## Bias Correction of Numerical Prediction Model Temperature Forecast

### Description
This project involves building and improving predictive models for forecasting the next day's maximum temperature (Next Tmax) using the "Bias correction of numerical prediction model temperature forecast Data Set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes 7,750 observations and 25 attributes, with the objective of improving forecast accuracy through statistical analysis and model refinement.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **R** or **RStudio** installed
- **tidyverse**, **caret**, **e1071**, **ggplot2**, **dplyr** libraries installed

### Installation and Setup
To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bias-correction-temperature-forecast.git
   cd bias-correction-temperature-forecast
   ```

2. **Set up the R Environment:**
   Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "caret", "e1071", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))
   ```

3. **Open the R Script:**
   Open `Regression Analysis.R` in R or RStudio.

### Using the Project
Once the R script is open, you can run the code to execute the following steps:

1. **Data Pre-processing:**
   - Check and handle missing values by removing rows with missing data.
   - Ensure variables have the correct type (e.g., convert "station" to a factor, exclude "date" as a predictor).

2. **Data Splitting:**
   - Split the data into training (60%), validation (20%), and testing (20%) sets based on the "date" variable.

3. **Initial Model:**
   - Fit a multiple linear regression model on the training data.
   - Predict on the validation set and calculate RMSE.

4. **Model Improvement:**
   - Refine the model by removing or transforming features and adding new ones.
   - Evaluate model performance using RMSE on the validation set to select the best model.

5. **Model Testing:**
   - Test the initial and improved models on the test set.
   - Report RMSE for both models on the test set.

### Results Analysis and Interpretation
- **Initial Model:** Discuss model quality, variable significance, and residuals.
- **Improved Model:** Explore enhancements made, significance of variables, and residuals.
- **Model Comparison:** Compare RMSE of initial and improved models on the test set.
